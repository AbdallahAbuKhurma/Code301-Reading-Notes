## How to Solve Programming Problems

### A simple set of steps

1. ***Read the problem completely twice:***

        You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can    explain the problem to someone else.
        If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.  Do not worry about wasting time here, because the   better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.

2. ***Solve the problem manually:***

        Programming is automation plain and simple.  You may have the ability to skip the manual steps and jump directly to code, but there is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write.

        It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around.  Which while can be fun, will make you look like an idiot in a programming interview and will probably cause you to sweat profusely.

3. ***Optimize the manual solution:***

        People often don’t realize how valuable this step is.  It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.

        What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

4. ***Write pseudo-code or comments:***

        What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.

        By doing this, we can know exactly what the structure of the code we are going to write is going to look like which makes the job of filling in the actual code later trivial.

5. ***Replace comments with real code:***

        This step should be extremely easy at this point.  If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.

        All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.

## Act like you make $1000/hr

     You have very few hours here on this earth. Still, many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission. The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth. They say yes to things they have no business doing. They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take. They spend hours watching low-quality television and social media when they should be productive and effective. See, many people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy.

## How to think like a programmer

Problem solving is the meta-skill.

We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.

Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):

        1. Try a solution.
        2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
        3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

1. ***Understand:***

        Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).

2. ***Plan:***

        Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

        Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

        In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

3. ***Divide:***

        Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

        Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

        Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

        After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.

4. ***Stuck:***

        First off, take a deep breath. Second, that’s fair.

        Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!

        The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.

## 5 Whys

* ***Assemble a Team***

        Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you’re trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator, who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

* ***Define the Problem***

        If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. For example, “Team A isn’t meeting its response time targets” or “Software release B resulted in too many rollback failures.”

* ***Ask the First “Why?”***

        Asking “Why?” sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.

* ***Ask “Why?” Four More Times***

        For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further “whys” in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you’ve just recorded.

* ***Know When to Stop***

        You’ll know that you’ve revealed the root cause of the problem when asking “why” produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident. (As we said earlier if you’re not sure that you’ve uncovered the real root cause.
