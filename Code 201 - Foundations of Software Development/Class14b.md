# What Google Learned About Teams

like most 25-year-olds, Julia Rozovsky wasn’t sure what she wanted to do with her life. She had worked at a consulting firm, but it wasn’t a good match. Then she became a researcher for two professors at Harvard, which was interesting but lonely. Maybe a big corporation would be a better fit. Or perhaps a fast-growing start-up. All she knew for certain was that she wanted to find a job that was more social. ‘‘I wanted to be part of a community, part of something people were building together,’’ she told me. She thought about various opportunities — Internet companies, a Ph.D. program — but nothing seemed exactly right. So in 2009, she chose the path that allowed her to put off making a decision: She applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Management.

project Aristotle’s researchers began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked. Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests? Or did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards? Based on those studies, the researchers scrutinized the composition of groups inside Google: How often did teammates socialize outside the office? Did they have the same hobbies? Were their educational backgrounds similar? Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy? They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments’ goals. They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team’s success.

After years of analyzing data and interviews from more than 180 teams across the company, Google found that the kinds of people (a.k.a. the individual personalities) in a team are not so relevant. Instead, the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams:

1. **Psychological Safety**

Psychological safety is about environment. It's about creating a safe culture in which team members feel "safe" enough to take an interpersonal risk. Encouraging team members to voice their opinions, even if it goes against the group, can be risky. However, teams that exhibit high psychological safety encourage risk-taking. Plus, when team members take risks, they aren't viewed as disruptive, disrespectful or incompetent.

2. **Dependability**

Dependability is about accountability. It's about reliability. It's about trust.

When everyone on the team is accountable, reliable and trustworthy, the team succeeds.

How many teams have you been on when one person shirks responsibility? We've all seen it before. A team can crumble when even one person can't be trusted to do the work. On a highly dependable team, every team member can trust that high quality work will be produced on time.

3. **Structure and clarity**

All teams need structure and clarity, so long as rules are not too rigid that they stifle progress.

When teams have structure and clarity, there are specific and clear performance standards and directives for the team to work and achieve. With these inputs, team members understand their function, purpose, expectations and performance objectives.

4. **Meaning**

No one wants to work in a job or organization without meaning or purpose. So, you can imagine how a team member feels working on a team without either meaning or purpose. There are many ways to create meaning within the construct of a team. For example, you can create meaning in the work itself or in the final product.

Google found that other ways to create meaning in work include creating financial security, supporting one's family, helping the team succeed, or exhibiting self-expression.

5. **Impact**

Work is about creating value and impact for others. Team members want to know - from their subjective perspective - that the work they are doing is creating impact. Also, team members want to feel that the team's work is helping to advance the organization's overall goals, mission and impact. Reserving time for each team member to reflect on their impact can be a valuable exercise to further purpose and meaning as well.
